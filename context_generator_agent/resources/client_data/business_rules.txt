Our business has a few simple rules.

A customer's email address must be a valid email format.
All orders must have a positive quantity.
The order_date should always be on or after the effective date of the customer record.
We use product_id as the unique identifier for our products.
The 'orders' table links our customers to their purchased products.
The `insert_data.py` script is used to ingest new order records into the database.
